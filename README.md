# Charged-particle-acceleration-in-strong-MHD-turbulence
A Monte-Carlo, simulation for charged particle acceleration in strong MHD turbulence. Several acceleration mechanisms can be implemented 
  - 1st order Fermi acceleration 
  - 2nd order Fermi acceleration 
  - Diffusive shock acceleration 
  - A combinaton of the previous (turbulent reconnection environment)
