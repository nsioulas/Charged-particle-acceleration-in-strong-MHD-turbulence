# Charged-particle-acceleration-in-strong-MHD-turbulence
A lattice, numerical simulation for charged particle acceleration in strong MHD turbulence. Several acceleration mechanisms can be implemented 1) 1st order Fermi acceleration 2) 2nd order Fermi acceleration 3) Diffusive shock acceleration 4) A combinaton of the previous
